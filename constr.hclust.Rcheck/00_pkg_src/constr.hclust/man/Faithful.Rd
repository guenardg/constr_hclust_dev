Erruption intervals during a time period of approximately eleven years
}
\details{
Erruption timing data of Old Faithful geyser (Yellowstone National
Park, WY, USA) between 2000 and 2011 were downloaded from website
http://www.geyserstudy.org (access time: Sun Dec 13 14:43:25 2020). The
original data series had 58527 eruption times and showed discontinuities
because of interruptions in data recording (caused by equipment malfunction,
maintenance, or onboard computer memory overrun caused by harsh weather
conditions interferring with satelite data transmission. The series was thus
split into 20 segments with continuous observations and the intervals between
the eruptions were calculated for each of them.

For exemplary purposes, the segments were decimated to a smaller size by
averaging individual time intervals using a 50-eruption wide Hann window and
then the decimated data segments were concatenated into a single data series
of 1142 estimates of the mean eruption interval.

data(Faithful)

## Distance matrix (Euclidean) of the mean intervals:

dst <- dist(Faithful$Interval)

## Segmenting the series with respect to eruption time intervals using
## chronological clustering (time-constrained Lance-Williams hierarchical
## agglomerative clustering):

chcl <- constr.hclust(dst, coords = Faithful$Date, chron = TRUE)

## Plotting the results:

### Partition sizes and the colors to display them:
parts <- c(2,3,4,5,6,7)
cols <- list(
  c("red","purple"),
  c("red","blue","purple"),
  c("red","orange","blue","purple"),
  c("red","orange","yellow","blue","purple"),
  c("red","orange","yellow","green","blue","purple"),
  c("red","orange","yellow","green","aquamarine","blue","purple")
)

### Plotting partitions with 2-7 segments:
par(mar=c(5,6.5,2,2))
plot(x=range(Faithful$Date), y=c(0.5,6.5), type="n", xlab="Time",
     ylab="Partitions\n\n", yaxt="n")
for(i in 1L:length(parts)) {
  chcl$coords[,"y"] <- i
  plot(chcl, parts[i], link=TRUE, lwd=25, hybrids="none",
       lwd.pt=0.5, cex=0, pch=21, plot=FALSE, lend=2, col=cols[[i]])
}
axis(2, at=1:length(parts), labels=sprintf("\%d groups",parts), las=1)

tmp <- which(!!diff(cutree(chcl,parts[i])))
data.frame(From=Faithful$Date[tmp],
           To=Faithful$Date[tmp+1])
