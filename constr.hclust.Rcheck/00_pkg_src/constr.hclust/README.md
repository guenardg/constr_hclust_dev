A version of this package is part of adespatial
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/adespatial/index.html

Function constr.lshclust, which is _not_ part of R package
adespatial, implement least squares hierarchical
agglomerative clustering. The method is parcimonious in its
memory usage and can thus be used with very large data sets.
However, this method is experimental and its properties have
yet to be formally studied in peer-reviewed literature before
it is advisable to use it in scientific studies. Please stay
tuned with recent developments pending further development in
that area.
